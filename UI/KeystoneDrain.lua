-- UI/KeystoneDrain.lua
-- On-demand drain prompt for the Mythic+ outcome record.
--
-- THE PROBLEM. The keystone "complete" chunk can only reach WoWCombatLog.txt by
-- riding an organic SPELL_CAST_FAILED: the addon rewrites the SPELL_FAILED_*
-- global error strings and the engine writes whichever one it needs into CLEU
-- arg 12. But a key ends with everyone standing still in a cleared dungeon and
-- nobody casting, and the logger frequently hearths out seconds later. Roughly
-- 40% of runs lost their outcome record this way, which is why so many reports
-- render "Completed" with no timer and no timed/depleted verdict.
--
-- WHY A BUTTON WORKS. Programmatic casting is dead on the custom client: every
-- cast-initiating function is protected and taints from insecure code, even out
-- of combat (see the note in KeystoneScan's outcome-flush section). What is NOT
-- blocked is a hardware click on a SecureActionButtonTemplate - the engine runs
-- that through its own secure path, so the click casts for real. Measured
-- 2026-08-09: 90 clicks produced 90 cast failures, and once the right global was
-- hijacked every log-visible failure carried a chunk (7/7 on disk, against 0/13
-- before the fix).
--
-- WHY FISHING. `/cast Fishing` with no pole throws "Must have a %s equipped."
-- instantly, with no target, no cooldown to wait on, and no class dependency -
-- which matters on classless, where "press something you have on cooldown" is
-- not a portable instruction. Its global is SPELL_FAILED_EQUIPPED_ITEM_CLASS.
-- With a pole equipped but no water it fails via SPELL_FAILED_NOT_HERE instead;
-- both are in the relay's hijack list, so either way the click carries a chunk.
--
-- COMBAT LOCK. Secure ATTRIBUTES cannot be set in combat, so the button is
-- built lazily on the first prompt rather than kept around for the whole run -
-- combat drops the moment a key completes, so by the +1s prompt we are reliably
-- out of it. If that ever does not hold, show() declines to open a button it
-- could not arm and waits for PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED instead of presenting a
-- button that silently cannot cast. Nothing is created until a key finishes.
--
-- PROGRESS IS LANDED-EVIDENCE, NEVER CLICKS. Clicks and carriers are not 1:1 -
-- every click fails, but only a fraction become log-visible events (7 carriers
-- from one clicking burst; gaps 0.15s to 8.7s, so lossy rather than throttled).
-- The relay already re-applies a chunk until CLEU arg 12 proves it landed and
-- only then advances, so a click that produces no carrier costs nothing and the
-- next one retries the same chunk. Counting clicks would show fake progress;
-- KeystoneScan.pendingOutcome is the truth.
