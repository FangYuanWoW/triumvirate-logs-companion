-- lets a rebranded build keep working without touching code: a per-tenant
-- packaging step can rename the folder (e.g. to TriumvirateLogsCompanion) and

-- a global WoW does not persist, and every captured run is lost SILENTLY on the
-- next reload. Deriving both from the folder name makes them agree by
-- construction (WoW already requires folder name == .toc basename, so the
-- folder cannot drift on its own).
--
-- Only this variable is brand-scoped. ALC_Config and the other saved vars keep
-- the ALC_ prefix on every brand ON PURPOSE: renaming those would orphan real
-- user settings that already exist on disk. This one is safe to scope because
-- no brand except the custom client has ever written it.

-- Version
-- 0.74.0 (Mythic+ standings keep themselves current, plus three wire frames we
-- were throwing away). On a tenant whose M+ arrives over the AIO wire:
--   * Own bests now refresh themselves. The server sends ReceiveTotalPoints
--     when its Score tab is shown, so a player's per-dungeon bests were only
--     ever captured if they happened to open that tab. We now send the same
--     zero-argument RequestTotalPoints ourselves, five seconds after a run
--     finishes. Verified 2026-09-05 by firing it on two characters in one
--     session: each got its OWN data back, which is also the proof there is no
--     way to read another player - none of the six Request* ops takes a player
--     argument. This does NOT reopen the never-send rule, which exists for
--     PedestalActivate / PedestalForfeit / MythicRewardChoice / SelectVaultItem
--     / SelectVaultSpec - ops that start a key, forfeit a run or spend a vault
--     pick. The op name is a literal at the one call site.
--   * ReceiveLeaderboard is recorded (server-wide top N plus each dungeon's
--     record key, time, holders and top scorer). It is the only cross-player M+
--     data this client can see, and it only arrives when the player opens that
--     tab - so a missing snapshot means "never viewed", not "empty".
--   * ShowRewardChoice is recorded onto the open run: both offered item ids and
--     the server's own "completed in MM:SS" string, which is an independent
--     reading of the run time from a different code path than
--     StopMythicTimerGUI's remaining-time arithmetic.
--   * ShowVaultGUI / UpdateVaultStatus are recorded AS GIVEN. Their payload has
--     never been observed (it needs a pending vault), so the arguments are
--     stored raw rather than mapped onto a guessed schema; name the fields once
--     a real frame lands.
-- Also keeps the class id from ReceiveTotalPoints, whose fourth argument was
-- previously discarded as unknown - it indexes the server addon's class-colour
-- table (6 = Death Knight, 3 = Hunter), so a best now carries the class that
-- earned it. Additive fields only; KS_RUNS_SCHEMA and SCHEMA_VERSION unchanged.
-- 0.73.0 (the auto-logging prompt asks BEFORE it starts): entering a monitored
-- zone used to start /combatlog and THEN ask, which made declining destructive
-- instead of free. The client opens a NEW dated combat-log file on every
-- off->on transition, so start-then-decline left a stub file holding the few
-- seconds between zoning in and clicking the button. Measured on a Mythic+
-- session: 19 dated files totalling 180 KB, each spanning 2-10 seconds, one per
-- dungeon zone-in that was declined - against ONE continuous 195 MB file for a
-- raid the player accepted. The popup now runs first and "Not now" touches
-- nothing, so a declined zone leaves no file at all. Silent mode and the
-- settings-toggle path are unchanged: both are explicit player actions and
-- still start immediately without asking. The third button (Hide Transmog)
-- now starts logging as well as hiding transmog, since it is an accept.
-- 0.72.0 (keystone runs record their boss kills and survive being abandoned):
-- two gaps in the durable Mythic+ run record, both specific to a tenant whose
-- keys come off the AIO wire rather than C_MythicPlus.
-- (1) boss_kills was never written for a single run. recordBossKill credits a
-- UNIT_DIED only when the name resolves in Zone/BossRegistry, and that registry
-- is a RAID boss list - EncounterTracker uses it to notice a raid switching
-- bosses - so no 5-man dungeon boss has ever been in it. Rather than widen a
-- raid structure to fix a keystone field, MarkBossKilled now reports the kill
-- through the new KeystoneScan.externalBossKill(). The wire is the better
-- source anyway: it names the boss by INDEX into the run's own list, so there
-- is no name matching and no combat-log witness to miss. Kills carry at_ms,
-- index, name and enc_done, and dedupe on index.
-- (2) a run closed as "abandoned" landed with no progress, no time taken and
-- no time remaining. closeRunRecord only stamps those from a live read, and
-- both abandon paths (a new run superseding a stale record; the final resume
-- poll finding no live key) have none by definition - the key is gone by then.
-- The wire handlers now mirror progress and clock onto the open record as the
-- run moves, plus last_progress_at_ms so a reader knows how stale they are, so
-- whatever was last true is already on the record however it closes. A normal
-- completion still overwrites the mirror from its live read.
-- Additive fields only; KS_RUNS_SCHEMA and SCHEMA_VERSION are unchanged.
-- 0.68.0 (per-content-type logging gates): a new log_raids toggle (Settings
-- panel, default ON) is the raid-side twin of log_dungeons - when off, entering
-- a raid or a world-boss zone no longer auto-starts /combatlog, so a player who
-- only wants their Mythic+ and 5-man runs logged can stop hand-disabling the
-- addon before every raid night. Both gates now run through one classifier in
-- ZoneMonitor: IsInInstance() decides indoor content ("raid" / "party"), and
-- outdoor world bosses and raid-event subzones (which report instanceType
-- "none") are matched by name against DefaultZones.OUTDOOR_RAID_ZONES. Content
-- the addon cannot positively identify is never gated. Two behavior changes
-- ride along: the gate now runs BEFORE the already-logging claim, so a session
-- carried in from other content (silent mode never auto-stops) is stopped on
-- entering blocked content instead of quietly logging through it - only a
-- session ALC itself started, never a manual /combatlog; and removing a zone
-- from the Monitored Zones list now records it as false rather than deleting
-- the key, so Z.start()'s defaults seeding stops resurrecting hand-removed
-- zones on the next login (the long-standing "the raid zones keep coming back"
-- report). "Restore Default Zones" on the zones page clears those tombstones.
-- 0.67.2 (opt-out for peer Character Advancement inspects): a new
-- cao_inspect_enabled toggle (Settings panel + /alc cao on|off, default ON)
-- stops the inspect rotation from calling C_CharacterAdvancement.InspectUnit on
-- other players. Relief valve for the class of client-side breakage where a game
-- patch retires a Character Advancement entry id that characters' stored builds
-- still reference: the client resolves every entry of an inspected build against
-- its local table, throws "CharacterAdvancementBuildEntry::UpdatePointers: entry
-- <id> not found" and can go down with it. That happens inside the client's own
-- inspect-response handler, before any addon code runs, so the pcall around the
-- request cannot catch it and there is nothing addon-side to guard - not asking
-- is the only lever. Turning it off costs peers' talents / hero build in reports;
-- gear, mystic enchants, pets and telemetry are unaffected, and the logger's own
-- build capture is untouched (your own build is already resolved client-side, so
-- it carries no added risk). When off, tryFinalize no longer waits on
-- INSPECT_CHARACTER_ADVANCEMENT_RESULT (it would never fire) and the missing-CAO
-- partial-retry is suppressed, so the rotation keeps its normal cadence instead
-- of eating the 3s have-talent-but-not-CA cutoff on every peer. No schema change
-- (SCHEMA_VERSION stays 7): peer CI simply omits the specialization fields it
-- cannot read.
-- 0.67.2 also fixes ALCSync channel placement. WotLK has no MoveChannelUp/Down
-- (Cataclysm API, nil here), so the old pushChannelDown() was always a silent
-- no-op and a slow login could leave ALCSync as channel 1 - stealing /1 and
-- topping the Channels list. The one rule the client follows is that a joining
-- channel takes the LOWEST FREE slot, so placement is purely a question of join
-- timing: VersionCheck now waits for the channel list to go quiet (5s, 45s cap)
-- instead of using a fixed delay, and repairs a bad slot by leaving, parking a
-- throwaway ALCPad channel in the hole it just freed, re-joining (which now
-- lands past the last channel) and dropping the pad - capped at 2 attempts and
-- skipped with no headroom for the pad. Also resolves the channel index fresh
-- at send time: a stale cached index could post the ALCver handshake into
-- whatever public channel had taken that slot.
-- 0.67.1 (keystone START record actually reaches the log): KeystoneScan
-- queued the "start" record on the relay's NORMAL ring while only "complete"
-- took the priority lane. SnapshotPipeline calls relay.clearRing() on every
-- PLAYER_REGEN_DISABLED, and a run's first pull always lands before the first
-- organic failed cast, so the start record was wiped every single time -
-- server-side telemetry across all reports that carried KS chunks found 100%
-- complete records and zero starts. Both lifecycle records now ride the
-- priority lane, which is deliberately preserved across pull-start ring
-- clears. No schema change (KS_SCHEMA_VERSION stays 1); the start record's
-- fields were always populated, they just never arrived. This matters because
-- the two records are lost to DIFFERENT failures - complete to a disconnect
-- or hearth at key-end, start to the ring clear - so a run now has to lose
-- both to end up with no keystone record at all.
-- 0.66.0 (durable Mythic+ run records): KeystoneScan now writes a full
-- per-run record into a new SavedVariablesPerCharacter store
-- (ALC_KeystoneRuns) for EVERY party member running the addon, not just the
-- logger: roster (name/realm/guid/class/race/level for all five, stamped at
-- key start), dungeon/level/affixes/timer budget, per-member death counts
-- (CLEU UNIT_DIED), outcome (timed/depleted/abandoned) and final
-- time/progress. Records open on MYTHIC_PLUS_STARTED (a crash mid-run still
-- leaves the attempt on disk), survive disconnects (PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD
-- polls the live keystone state and re-attaches or adopts the run), and close
-- on MYTHIC_PLUS_COMPLETE. The Logs Uploader reads the
-- SavedVariables file from disk and posts new records to the site; dedup is
-- server-side. FIFO cap of KS_RUNS_CAP records; the open run is never
-- evicted. Roster members also carry an embedded compact CI (gear, mystic
-- enchants, CAO build): own from LocalScan.buildLocalCI, peers from the
-- inspect cache as InspectLoop's rotation lands them (first copy wins;
-- resume/close passes fill stragglers). Additionally harvests the client's
-- OWN best-run history (FrameXML C_Keystones / ReadCustomWTF("Keystones"):
-- per-dungeon + per-affix-set bests for every character on the install,
-- with date/time/overtime/level/affixes/class-tagged roster) into
-- ALC_KeystoneRuns.bests - retroactive history predating the addon. No
-- transport/codec changes; the KS relay chunk family is untouched and CI
-- SCHEMA_VERSION stays 7.
-- 0.65.1 (dungeon boss registry sync): BossRegistry now carries the full
-- 5-man dungeon rosters (all wings, rares included) instead of the partial
-- dev-fixture lists. Matters for chain-pulls: the per-pull CI republish rides
-- PLAYER_REGEN_DISABLED, so a boss engaged without dropping combat (trash
-- pulled straight into the boss) only gets a mid-combat CI republish via the
-- BossRegistry name match. Unregistered bosses (e.g. Herod) produced no CI
-- inside their encounter window, and the backend's instance-difficulty
-- fallback then had nothing to read - mythic dungeon kills landed as
-- 'normal'. Data-only change; no transport/schema impact.
-- 0.64.0 (Season 10 classless realms - the classless realms): adds two new
-- detected server profiles, "a classless realm" (Freepick) and "a classless realm" (Wildcard),
-- for the classless Season 10 realms. They run the SAME custom launcher
-- client as a custom-client tenant, so they share the custom client's ENTIRE capture path (CAO /
-- MysticEnchant / transmog / Mythic+ / hero builds) - they are separate
-- profiles ONLY so the snapshot's `server` tag tenant-routes them to their own
-- backend, exactly the Triumvirate-vs-a stock-client tenant pattern on the the custom client side.
-- Positive custom-client-only capture gates now check Core.Profile.the custom-client gate
-- (custom-client OR a classless realm OR a classless realm); the negative `not isStockClient()` gates
-- already covered them. Two small classless-only CI emits ride the local CI,
-- gated on C_Player:IsHero() so non-Hero (every other tenant) snapshots
-- stay clean of vestigial fields:
--   * ci.primary_stat = { id, token } from C_PrimaryStat:GetActivePrimaryStat()
--     (Enum.PrimaryStat 1..5 = Str/Agi/Int/Spirit/Stam) - the Hero-forced
--     melee/ranged/caster axis.
--   * ci.game_mode    = { wildcard=<bool>, draft=<bool> } from
--     C_GameMode:IsGameModeActive(Enum.GameMode.WildCard/Draft).
-- These are additive fields; SCHEMA_VERSION bumps 5 -> 6 so the server demuxer
-- can key on the new field set. NOTE: a schema bump forces a one-time
-- inspect-cache repopulate on first 0.64.0 boot for EVERY tenant (via
-- InspectCache.rehydrate's schema guard, same as the 0.2.5 / 0.30.4 bumps) -
-- harmless, repopulates within the first cold inspect cycle. No transport/codec
-- changes; the F-frame wire format is unchanged. Inert for existing tenants:
-- their detected profile and every capture branch outcome are unchanged, and
-- the two new fields never appear on their (non-Hero) CIs.
-- 0.63.3 (guardian scan state is per-fight): the server recycles despawned
-- summons' GUIDs, so a guardian GUID resolved to one owner early in a session
-- can belong to a DIFFERENT owner's summon on a later boss. GuardianTracker's
-- session-lifetime resolved cache kept vouching for the stale owner and never
-- emitted a correcting pair - the server then applied the stale pair
-- report-wide by exact GUID, silently crediting later bosses' guardians to
-- the wrong player (a support who swapped off after one fight kept "earning"
-- Spirit of Life damage on every later boss from other supports' recycled
-- spirits). seenGuids is now wiped on PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED so every fight
-- re-resolves each guardian from scratch and re-publishes its pair - giving
-- the server per-encounter pairs it can use to scope ownership when a GUID's
-- owner changes mid-report (server-side scoping ships separately). Details
-- clears its whole pet cache per segment for the same reason. No
-- transport/codec changes; PP wire format unchanged.
-- 0.63.2 (guardian owner-scan retry): GuardianTracker no longer gives up on a
-- guardian GUID after one failed tooltip scan. The first CLEU row a proc
-- guardian logs is typically its spawn instant, when a tooltip render by GUID
-- can miss (object not yet queryable, or out of render range) - and the
-- scan-once guard then poisoned that GUID for the whole session, so a
-- fight-long guardian (e.g. a Shieldmaiden shielding the raid for minutes)
-- never got an owner pair and its output landed on an orphan creature row
-- server-side. Failed scans now retry on later rows from the same GUID with
-- exponential backoff (2s doubling to a 30s cap, 12 attempts max); a success
-- is still final and resolved GUIDs are never re-rendered. No transport/codec
-- changes; PP wire format unchanged.
-- 0.62.1 (Triumvirate instance auto-logging): adds the full TBC + WotLK
-- instance set to DefaultZones so auto-/combatlog fires in Triumvirate raids
-- and dungeons (Karazhan, The Obsidian Sanctum, Ulduar, ICC, the WotLK/TBC
-- 5-mans, etc.). Names are the verbatim stock 3.3.5a Map.dbc MapName strings
-- (= what GetInstanceInfo() returns), extracted from the Triumvirate client -
-- NOT the backend roster strings, which carry "The"-prefix/wing-split drift.
-- Includes the stock-name variants for a few vanilla 5-mans (Deadmines,
-- Stormwind Stockade, Blackrock Spire). Purely additive to the shared zone
-- list; inert for the custom client/a stock-client tenant (their clients don't return these names).
-- 0.62.0 (Triumvirate server support): adds a third detected server profile,
-- "triumvirate" (stock WotLK 3.3.5a private server, realm "Triumvirate"). It is
-- an stock-client-family client - same standard talent-group (dual-spec) reader, and
-- none of the custom client's CAO / MysticEnchant / transmog / Mythic+ API surface - so
-- every capture-side branch now gates on Core.Profile.isStockClient() (a stock-client tenant OR
-- Triumvirate) instead of a a bare profile equality test. The ONLY divergence is
-- the `server` tag the snapshot stamps ("triumvirate"), for backend tenant
-- routing. Inert for the custom client and a stock-client tenant users: their detected profile and
-- every branch outcome are unchanged. No SCHEMA_VERSION bump - the Triumvirate
-- CI reuses a stock client's existing talent_groups shape (schema 5). Realm string
-- confirmed 2026-06-15 via clean in-game probe.
-- 0.60.6 (peer-instance freshness): re-stamp a peer CI's instance from the
-- logger's LIVE GetInstanceInfo at broadcast time, instead of carrying the value
-- frozen when that peer was last inspected. Instance (zone + difficulty) is a
-- "where is the logger now" property shared by the whole raid, but a re-broadcast
-- peer CI (the dominant CI volume) previously re-stamped only boss/pull and left
-- ci.instance untouched - so after the raid changed zones, cached peers kept
-- emitting the OLD zone/difficulty until each happened to be re-inspected.
-- Smoking gun: report 10627 / encounter 340057 (Snowgrave / Heroic) had 20 of 22
-- CIs stamped "Molten Core / Ascended" (the raid's prior instance), which is not
-- unanimous, so the backend's ALC difficulty fallback bailed and the kill
-- defaulted to 'normal'. Fix stamps live instance in both broadcast paths
-- (SnapshotPipeline.publishPeerInspects + the deferred drainDeferQueue); the
-- logger's own CI already builds with a live instanceInfo() so it self-heals.
-- A changed instance busts the F-frame durable hash, so it costs ONE re-keyframe
-- per peer per zone change, then collapses back to refs - steady-state efficiency
-- within an instance is unchanged. No SCHEMA_VERSION bump: the CI shape is
-- identical (instance field already existed), only WHEN it's repopulated changed,
-- so existing inspect-cache entries keep working and self-correct at next
-- broadcast. No transport/codec changes; 0.60.0 wire format unchanged.
-- 0.60.5 (logger spec-change capture): the logger's OWN mid-session spec / hero-
-- build / mystic-enchant swap is now captured on a custom-client tenant by registering the
-- native C_CharacterAdvancement change events (a stock-client tenant-safe via TryRegisterEvent;
-- those APIs are absent there). Previously only peers' spec changes were picked
-- up (via the re-inspect cadence); the logger never re-inspects self, so their
-- own respec went unrecorded mid-raid. No transport/codec changes.
-- 0.60.4 (own-CI hotfix + guild field): two changes.
-- (1) Fix the logger's own gear/mystic/talents rendering blank on their own
-- report - a regression since the 0.60.0 codec overhaul. The own CI is
-- delta-encoded like peers (keyframe on first sight, then KEYFRAME_REFs), but
-- the own keyframe is only emitted once at login/zone-in (pre-combat): the
-- relay can't drain it out of combat, the pull-start clearQueue wipes it, and
-- every later own publish is a ref the server can't resolve without the
-- keyframe -> no local row. (Peers are immune: re-inspected every boss, so
-- their keyframes land mid-session.) Fix: at PLAYER_REGEN_DISABLED bust
-- lastOwnHash + FrameBuilder.forceKeyframe(ownGuid) so a full own keyframe
-- re-lands inside each pull's logged window.
-- (2) Add the guild NAME to the ci.player blob (the rich {name,rank_name,
-- rank_index} stays at ci.guild). Additive; backend ignores unknown fields.
-- No transport/codec changes; 0.60.0 wire format unchanged.
-- 0.60.3 (empty-gear hotfix): stop the boss-transition re-inspect race from
-- blanking out raiders' gear. On a boss pull EncounterTracker re-queues the
-- whole raid for an immediate re-inspect; on the a stock-client tenant profile the inspect
-- finalizes the moment INSPECT_TALENT_READY fires, but the inspected unit's
-- GetInventoryItemLink often hasn't ripened yet as raiders scatter past the
-- 28y inspect range, so readGear() returns zero slots. That empty read was
-- finalized as success and cached/published as the boss keyframe with a newer
-- captured_at, so it shadowed the good trash-pull capture and the player
-- rendered naked on the boss tab. Fix: an empty gear read is no longer a clean
-- success - InspectLoop.finalizeInspect carries the last-known-good gear
-- forward onto the re-stamped CI (talents/spec stay fresh) and retries up to
-- INSPECT_GEAR_RETRY_MAX times to catch a real gear swap, and SnapshotPipeline
-- never broadcasts a gearless peer CI (cold-start guard). No transport/codec
-- changes; 0.60.0 wire format unchanged.
-- 0.60.2 (inspect hotfix follow-up): close the in-flight finalize race that
-- v0.60.1 left open. v0.60.1 stopped the loop STARTING new inspects while an
-- inspect window was open, but a peer inspect already in flight still
-- finalized (event-driven) and called ClearInspectPlayer(), wiping the
-- buffer the user's open window reads from. Symptom: right after a boss kill
-- (loop queues a fresh full-raid sweep) the FIRST inspect-window open showed
-- no tooltips / naked model, a second open of the same player was fine.
-- Fix: gate every ClearInspectPlayer() call on the new inspectBufferInUse()
-- predicate (character pane OR inspect window shown), so a finishing peer
-- inspect can't clear the buffer out from under the user. Details and Skada
-- never call ClearInspectPlayer at all; the next NotifyInspect repoints the
-- buffer regardless, so the clear is optional. No transport/codec changes.
-- 0.60.1 (inspect hotfix): the background inspect loop now stands down while
-- the user has an INSPECT window open, not just their own character pane.
-- WoW 3.3.5 has a single global last-inspected-unit buffer; firing
-- NotifyInspect on a peer while the user inspects a raider stripped that
-- target's equipped-slot tooltips to bare names and reset the 3D model to
-- naked. The v0.30.12 pause gate only covered the user's own character pane
-- (the custom character frame); the inspect-frame case (the custom inspect frame /
-- stock InspectFrame) was missed. Details and Skada already yield on an open
-- inspect frame; ALC was the only inspect-firing addon that didn't. Also
-- removed an orphaned InspectFrame:Hide() in the deferred vanity rescan -
-- ALC no longer opens its own inspect frame, so that Hide() only ever slammed
-- shut the user's manual inspect window (visible as the stock InspectFrame on
-- a stock-client tenant). No transport/codec changes; 0.60.0 wire format unchanged.
-- 0.60.0 (codec overhaul RELEASED): CI/PP/TS now emit EXCLUSIVELY as
-- [[ALC_F_v1_c2_...]] dict-deflated frames via FrameBuilder; the legacy
-- per-family base64 envelopes ([[ALC_CI_/PP_/TS_]]) and the c1/c2 transport
-- experiments were removed from EMIT. One dict-deflate + base64 per bundled
-- frame, plus delta/keyframe for gear (full CI on first sight, tiny refs after)
-- cut relay drains ~2.75x on a real key. frame_codec defaults to "c2" (no /alc
-- toggle); when the FrameBuilder can't run (dict/libs not ready) the pipelines
-- drop LOUDLY (throttled warn) rather than silently degrade. KS stays on its own
-- legacy [[ALC_KS_v1_]] priority lane (unbundled). The server demuxer (decodes
-- BOTH the new frames AND the legacy envelopes) shipped to prod first; legacy
-- DECODE stays server-side forever for version skew.
-- 0.52.0 (pending, dev on feat/keystone-capture; VERSION stays 0.51.0 until
-- release): KS (keystone) chunk family - fourth ALC family, parallel to CI/PP/
-- TS. Event-driven (not periodic): one "start" record on MYTHIC_PLUS_STARTED
-- and one "complete" record on MYTHIC_PLUS_COMPLETE, the latter carrying the
-- authoritative timed-vs-depleted boolean (arg1). Rides the same
-- SpellFailedRelay transport under [[ALC_KS_v1_...]]. custom-client-only
-- (C_MythicPlus absent on a stock-client tenant -> module inert). A thin {is_active, level,
-- dungeon_id} marker also rides ci.instance.keystone so mid-run CI snapshots
-- are self-describing. Schema not yet consumed server-side.
-- 0.50.0: TS (telemetry) chunk family ships. Third ALC chunk family,
-- parallel to CI (combatant info) and PP (pet pairs): periodic encounter
-- snapshots of player positions/vitals + a CLEU-built hostile NPC ledger,
-- transiting the existing SpellFailedRelay under the [[ALC_TS_v1_...]]
-- envelope. Self-throttles against relay backlog; schema not yet consumed
-- server-side, so a dropped snapshot is cosmetic.
-- 0.42.1: roster-cache perf pass. InspectLoop now keeps a GUID->unit hash
-- (rebuilt on roster events, lazy-revalidated on miss) instead of rescanning
-- raid1..raidN per resolveUnit/pickNext call. SnapshotPipeline.deferQueue
-- switched from table.remove(queue,1) to a head/tail FIFO, eliminating the
-- O(n) shift per drained peer in large-group inspect bursts.
-- 0.42.0: new PP chunk family for ground-truth {owner, pet} GUID pairs
-- captured from the controlled-pet unit slots (raidNpet / partyNpet / pet).
-- Rides the existing SpellFailedRelay transport with a distinct envelope
-- ([[ALC_PP_v1_...]]) so the server parser can route pet pairs independently
-- of CI snapshots. Relay landed-evidence + UIErrorsFrame suppressor
-- generalized to match the family prefix [[ALC_ so both chunk families
-- transit cleanly through the same SPELL_CAST_FAILED hijack.
C.VERSION = "0.74.0"
-- Bumped to 3 in 0.2.0: snapshot header gained a `server` field
-- ("triumvirate" | "frostmourne" | "unknown") so the backend can dispatch per-server
-- parsing for talents / mystic / vanity.
-- Bumped to 4 in 0.2.5: added transmog_viewing field on local CIs (logger's
-- "show transmog on inspect" preference). Backend uses this to flag reports
-- where peer-gear data may be poisoned by the custom client's q=6/ilvl=1 mythic
-- appearance overlays. Forces an inspect-cache wipe on first 0.2.5 boot
-- via InspectCache.rehydrate's schema guard; repopulates within the first
-- cold cycle. (A short-lived 0.3.0 experiment that dropped vanity_item_id
-- entirely was reverted before broad release; that path also bumped schema
-- to 4 but with a different shape, so users who briefly ran 0.3.0 should
-- expect a clean inspect cache repopulation regardless.)
-- Bumped to 5 in 0.30.4: ci.talents (a stock-client tenant path) now ships both spec slots
-- as `{ talent_groups = { [1]={tabs}, [2]={tabs} }, active_group = N }`,
-- with talents keyed by the game's actual talent index instead of insertion
-- order. Pre-v5 a stock-client tenant captures only read slot 1 by default and silently
-- mis-attributed any character whose active spec was in slot 2 (root cause
-- for Themeatman / Saws looking like Arms while raiding as Fury). Forces an
-- inspect-cache wipe on first 0.30.4 boot via InspectCache.rehydrate's
-- schema guard.
