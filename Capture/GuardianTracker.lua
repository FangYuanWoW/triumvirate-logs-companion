-- Capture/GuardianTracker.lua
-- Resolves slot-less player-controlled guardians to their owners via unit
-- tooltip scan and feeds the {owner, pet} pairs into PetPipeline - the same
-- PP record lane PetTracker uses.
--
-- PetTracker covers the controlled-pet UNIT SLOTS (UnitGUID("raidNpet")).
-- Proc-summoned guardians never occupy a slot, and many of them (Primalist
-- "Spirit of Life" being the canonical case: one fresh GUID per melee crit)
-- also emit no SPELL_SUMMON, so neither the slot sweep nor the server's
-- summon inference can ever bind them. The client itself still knows the
-- owner: rendering the unit tooltip by GUID yields an "<Owner>'s Minion"
-- line even for units that have no unit token. This is the same technique
-- the bundled Details port uses (its DetailsPetOwnerFinder tooltip scan);
-- 3.3.5-era meters (Skada) use it as well.
--
-- Trigger: CLEU source or dest flags carrying TYPE_PET or TYPE_GUARDIAN
-- plus CONTROL_PLAYER plus REACTION_FRIENDLY. A successful scan is final
-- FOR THE CURRENT FIGHT; a failed one is retried on a later CLEU row from
-- the same GUID with exponential backoff (2s doubling to a 30s cap, 12
-- attempts max). The first row a guardian ever logs is usually its spawn
-- instant (raid buffs blanket it the same millisecond it appears), and a
-- tooltip render at that moment can miss: the object may not be queryable
-- client-side yet, or it spawned out of render range. A long-lived
-- guardian keeps logging rows for the whole fight, so a later attempt
-- lands once the unit is rendered.
--
-- ALL scan state - successes included - is wiped when the player leaves
-- combat (PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED). The server recycles despawned summons'
-- GUIDs, so a GUID resolved to one owner earlier in the session can
-- belong to a DIFFERENT owner's summon a few fights later; a
-- session-lifetime "resolved" cache would keep vouching for the stale
-- owner and never emit the correcting pair. Ownership is a per-fight
-- fact, not a per-session one - the Details port encodes the same rule
-- by clearing its whole pet cache every segment. Re-resolving a
-- persistent pet each fight costs one tooltip render (a few hundredths
-- of a ms) and re-publishes its pair, which is exactly what lets the
-- server scope pairs per-encounter when owners change mid-report. The
-- backoff bounds a never-resolvable GUID (e.g. a despawned one-proc
-- guardian) to 12 renders per fight.
--
-- Scope notes:
--   * Slot pets (0xF140 space) get re-resolved here too when they act in
--     the combat log before/without a UNIT_PET slot observation. The server
--     dedups pairs, and the tooltip answer agrees with the slot answer, so
--     the redundancy is harmless and buys coverage for out-of-range owners.
--   * Owner names from the tooltip are validated against the client's unit
--     resolver (UnitGUID/UnitIsPlayer by name works for the player and any
--     group member on 3.3.5) before a pair is trusted. A tooltip line that
--     happens to pattern-match but names no group member is dropped.
--   * A guardian that despawns before its first combat-log row resolves to
--     an empty tooltip and is marked failed; its GUID never recurs (fresh
--     GUID per spawn), so there is no retry ladder.
