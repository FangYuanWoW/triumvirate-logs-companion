-- Filtering here makes a rejection a boolean instead of a tick, with no
-- deferral, so a peer who steps into range is eligible on the very next tick.
--
-- Also promotes never-captured peers: previously one gate_fail created a cache
-- entry, which demoted them out of rule 1 into the rule 2/3 crowd. Now they
-- stay rule-1 priority until they are actually captured.
