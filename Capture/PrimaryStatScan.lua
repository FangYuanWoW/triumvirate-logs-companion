-- Capture/PrimaryStatScan.lua
-- Per-pull roster sweep of GetUnitPrimaryStat, cached by player GUID.
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS
-- Classless (Season 10) characters are all class "Hero" with no meaningful
-- spec, so the only build axis a player picks is their PATH - Strength /
-- Agility / Intelligence / Healing / Duality. The server currently infers that
-- from a permanent marker aura in the combat log, but the aura only fires when
-- it is APPLIED (login / zone-in / respec), so roughly three quarters of the
-- rows it produces are forward-filled rather than observed. Reading the value
-- straight off the client turns inference into direct observation.
--
-- WHY IT DOES NOT USE THE INSPECT QUEUE
-- GetUnitPrimaryStat(unit) is a plain unit-data read. Unlike gear, it needs no
-- NotifyInspect round-trip, does not touch the single global inspect buffer,
-- and therefore does not have to stand down while the character pane or an
-- inspect window is open. So it does not join InspectLoop's one-at-a-time
-- rotation - it sweeps the WHOLE unresolved roster on each tick instead, which
-- converges far faster than gear capture can.
--
-- It does reuse InspectLoop's roster map (GUID -> unit token), because that is
-- already maintained on roster change and is exactly the input this needs.
--
-- CACHE SCOPE IS PER PULL, DELIBERATELY
-- The path is per-encounter mutable: players genuinely respec between bosses
-- (a classless realm has characters ranked under two different paths in one night).
-- A session-scoped cache would resolve someone on the first pull and then
-- report that stale path for the rest of the raid - worse than not capturing
-- them at all, because it would look like confident direct observation while
-- being wrong. So the cache is keyed on EncounterTracker.pullId and resets
-- whenever the pull changes.
--
-- "NO VALUE" HAS THREE CAUSES, AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME EVENT
-- The call can (a) THROW, (b) succeed and return nil for a Hero we cannot
-- currently track, or (c) succeed and return nil because the unit has no path
-- at all. Only (b) is worth retrying. (a) is bounded by MAX_ERRORS - a unit
-- that throws will keep throwing - and (c) is permanent. None of the three can
-- ever be mistaken for DATA: only a real value writes, so a failure never
-- files a player under a path they did not pick.
--
-- nil MEANS TWO DIFFERENT THINGS
-- For a HERO unit, nil means "not trackable yet" (out of range / not loaded):
-- it never writes and never evicts, the GUID stays queued and is retried next
-- tick. For a NON-HERO unit, nil means "has no path at all" and is permanent -
-- verified in game 2026-07-27, where a WARRIOR that was visible AND inside
-- inspect range still returned nil on every sample while a HERO party member
-- resolved 7/7. Non-Hero units are therefore dropped from the queue on sight
-- rather than retried; conflating the two would leave the unresolved set
-- permanently non-empty on every non-classless tenant (nobody is Hero on
-- any non-classless tenant) and the sweep would never go quiet.
--
-- Once the unresolved set empties, the sweep stops entirely until the next
-- pull, so a resolved raid costs nothing.

-- A unit whose read keeps THROWING is not the same as one that keeps

-- The sweep RIDES InspectLoop's 1s timer but must not inherit its CADENCE.
-- Those two loops have opposite shapes: inspect fires ONE NotifyInspect per
-- tick and is paced at 1s because it is a server round-trip that can be
-- throttled. This is a purely local read with nothing to throttle, but it
-- touches EVERY unresolved unit per pass - so at 1Hz an out-of-range player
-- would be polled ~300 times across a five-minute fight.
--
-- The value is static within a pull (the path can only change between
-- encounters), so the only question a retry answers is "has this player come
-- into range yet". Every few seconds is ample for that, and it cuts the work
-- by the same factor. Resolution speed is unaffected: anyone in range at the
-- pull is captured on the first pass.
