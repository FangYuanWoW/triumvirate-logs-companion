-- Settle-aware own-CI refresh for spec / build / mystic-enchant changes.
--
-- The change events fire BEFORE the client-side build has fully settled:
-- GetActiveSpecID and the CAO talent reads in readCAOForUnit("player") can
-- still return the PRE-swap build for a beat (observed live: own CI hash stayed
-- unchanged through the learn/unlearn burst, then flipped seconds later). A
-- single immediate re-read therefore misses the swap, which is why the logger's
-- own respec was captured only intermittently. So we:
--   1. (the custom client only) kick a per-unit-keyed self CAO inspect to nudge the
--      client cache. C_CharacterAdvancement.InspectUnit is per-unit-keyed (see
--      InspectLoop note), NOT the global NotifyInspect buffer, so this can't
--      clobber an in-flight peer capture. a stock-client tenant has no C_CharacterAdvancement
--      and reads own talents straight from GetTalentInfo, so it's skipped there.
--   2. Re-read publishOwnIfChanged on a short backoff. publishOwnIfChanged
--      hash-dedups, so the first re-read that sees the settled build publishes
--      and the rest are no-ops. The whole burst of change events coalesces into
--      one backoff schedule via the ownRefreshScheduled guard.
-- On an the custom client CAO spec swap the new active build is readable almost
-- immediately, but GetActiveSpecID / the per-talent reads in
-- readCAOForUnit("player") can lag the swap event by a beat. We can't watch the
-- content hash to detect "settled" because publishOwnIfChanged hashes the whole
-- CI INCLUDING captured_at (a wall-clock timestamp), so the hash changes every
-- second regardless of build - it only dedups reads within the same second.
-- So we just re-read at a few fixed offsets past the swap: the last one is well
-- clear of any settle lag, and each captures whatever the build is then.
-- publishOwnIfChanged still emits a frame each time, but these are pre-pull
-- keyframes (you can't swap spec in combat) and the next pull's
-- PLAYER_REGEN_DISABLED re-read + force-keyframe lands the authoritative one
-- inside the logged window anyway. The ownRefreshScheduled guard coalesces the
-- burst of swap events into a single set of re-reads.
